Fitting Logistic Regression Model

In this project, we demonstrated the process of fitting a logistic regression model in R and evaluating its accuracy. We generated dummy data and used it to train the logistic regression model. The model was then used to make predictions on the data, and the accuracy of these predictions was calculated by comparing them to the actual labels. 

Logistic regression is a popular method for binary classification problems, and it can provide valuable insights into the relationship between independent variables and the probability of a certain outcome. By visualizing the data, fitting the model, and assessing its accuracy, we gained a better understanding of how the logistic regression algorithm can be utilized to make predictions.

The accuracy of the model can serve as an indication of its performance, although it's important to note that the results may vary when using real-world data. It is recommended to further evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability.

Overall, this project highlights the steps involved in fitting a logistic regression model in R and assessing its accuracy. These techniques can be applied to various binary classification problems and serve as a foundation for more advanced modeling and analysis.
